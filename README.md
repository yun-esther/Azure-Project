# Azure-Project

The Azure Honeypot & Sentinel SIEM project is a comprehensive cybersecurity initiative that uses the power of Microsoft Azure to create a simulated environment for attracting, monitoring, and analyzing potential cyber threats. The honeynet in Microsoft Azure aggregated seven log sources into Microsoft Sentinel (SIEM), enabling a comprehensive analysis of security data. The project's primary objective is to create a secure cloud infrastructure, demonstrating adherence to industry security standards and best practices.
